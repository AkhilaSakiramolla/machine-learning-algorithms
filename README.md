# Implementation of Machine Learning algorithms
  
This repository contains a collections of machine learning algorithm implementations focused on solving different problems like regression and classification.

The folders in the repository contain the repective sorce code files for each of the implementations along with the corresponding results and output files.

Note: All the source codes are built in python and do not use any pre-existing machine learning libraries.

Below are some of the algorithm implementations covered in this repository:

  1) Linear Regression
  2) Logistic Regression
  3) Gaussian Process
  4) Bias variance decomposition
